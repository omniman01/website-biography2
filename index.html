                <h3>How It Started/ Early Career</h3>
                <p>Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, better known by his stage name RZA (pronounced /ˈrɪzə/; born July 5, 1969), is an American Grammy winning music producer, author, rapper, and occasional actor, director, and screenwriter. A prominent figure in hip hop music, he is the de facto leader of the Wu-Tang Clan. He has produced almost all of Wu-Tang Clan's albums as well as many Wu-Tang solo and affiliate projects. He subsequently gained attention for his work scoring and acting in films. He has also released solo albums under the alter-ego Bobby Digital. In addition to the Wu-Tang Clan and his solo releases, RZA was also a founding member of the rap group Gravediggaz where he used the name The Rzarector. He has made cameos in several movies including Coffee and Cigarettes, American Gangster, Gospel Hill, Life Is Hot in Cracktown, Ghost Dog, Funny People, Repo Men.

        <h3>Forming The Clan</h3>
        <p>In 1992 Wu-Tang Clan was officially formed, taking its name from the film Shaolin and Wu Tang. RZA stepped up as the group’s unofficial leader and producer and Jones was to be known as Ol’ Dirty Bastard, they released their first album the same year. The group were also said to have created backronyms for the group name Wu Tang Clan such as ‘We Usually Take All N****as Garments’ and ‘Witty Unpredictable Talent And Natural Game.’ 

        The group’s first sign of success was in 1993 when they independently released ‘Protect Ya Neck’ which gathered popularity in the underground hip hop scene. Due to each member's need to pursue solo projects outside the group it proved tricky to find a record deal that would suit them all until Loud/RCA agreed to allow them to pursue solo projects alongside the group and they released their debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) in 1993.</p>

                    <h3> Soundtracks For Movies</h3>
                    <p>If you've seen the films Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai, Kill Bill Vol. 1 and/or Kill Bill Vol. 2, then you've undoubtedly seen the name RZA up on the silver screen, listed amongst the credits alongside the words "Original Music By" or "Composer."
                        As the sonic brainchild behind the Wu, RZA took the collective's love of kung fu and samurai films to the next level, filling his beats with atonal noize and decidedly Eastern sounding elements, ranging from strange, exotic strings to the wailing dissonance you often heard swelling in the background of the climactic kung fu showdowns featured in Shaw Brothers films.</p>
